# 🚗 Car Price Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The demand for used cars has surged, outpacing the new car market due to slower new car sales. This growth presents a unique challenge: **How can we accurately price pre-owned vehicles?**  

This project aims to develop **machine learning models** to predict **used car prices** based on various features, helping businesses optimize pricing strategies and stay competitive.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains detailed information on used cars, including:  
✔ **Make & Model**  
✔ **Year of Manufacture**  
✔ **Mileage & Condition**  
✔ **Fuel Type & Transmission**  
✔ **Selling Price**
