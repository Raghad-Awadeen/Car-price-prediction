# 1. Project Title
### Car-price-prediction
# 2. Project Description
#### The demand for used cars in the market has significantly increased, particularly as the sales of new cars have slowed down in recent times. Consequently, the pre-owned car market has experienced continuous growth, surpassing the size of the new car market. As a result, establishing an effective pricing scheme for these used cars becomes crucial for success in this expanding market. To address this challenge, we are organizing a used car price prediction competition, where you provide a dataset containing information about used cars, including their corresponding prices.
#### The objective is to develop accurate machine learning models that can predict the prices of the used cars in the test set based on the given input features. By devising such models, participants can assist businesses in formulating profitable strategies using differential pricing and gaining a competitive edge in the market.
